HiðŸ‘‹,

My name is Mattias Karlsson, and I've been doing technical stuff since the mid-80s, it all started with the Commodore 128, but the true passion came with the Amiga.

At present day I'm a partner and technical fellow at WCOM AB, a Microsoft Gold Partner located in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Current passion topics are community, open-source, DevOps, and cloud technologies. Mostly active within the .NET open source community, mostly known there for being one of the maintainers behind the Cake build orchestration tool and LitJSON JSON serializer, but maintain around thirty or so .NET project and contribute to a few more.

Most importantly outside of work and play, father of two and husband of oneâ™¥
