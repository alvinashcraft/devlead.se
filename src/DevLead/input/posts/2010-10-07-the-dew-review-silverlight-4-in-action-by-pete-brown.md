So, I am finally getting around to writing some long-overdue reviews. First up is a great new Silverlight book from <a href="http://manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning Publications</a> – <a href="http://manning.com/pbrown/" target="_blank">Silverlight 4 in Action</a>, authored by <a href="http://10rem.net/" target="_blank">Pete Brown</a>. This is a revised (and expanded and totally revamped) edition of Silverlight 2 in Action by <a href="http://cornucopia30.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Chad Campbell</a> and <a href="http://riathoughts.com/bio/" target="_blank">John Stockton</a>.

(Full disclosure: I was given a free copy of the eBook for review. However, I had already purchased the MEAP (<a href="http://manning.com/about/meap" target="_blank">Manning Early Access Preview</a>) and pre-ordered the print edition of the book earlier this year.)

In short, I absolutely recommend this book. It makes a great introduction to Silverlight and the ultimate reference for experienced developers, all in one book.

I will spare you a rehashing of the <a href="http://manning.com/pbrown/excerpt_contents.html" target="_blank">table of contents</a>, but the content of book really flows nicely from introductory material to some more advanced topics. There aren’t many parts of the book I would consider optional for serious Silverlight developers. Sometimes when I am reading a tech book, I will feel compelled to skip a section or even an entire chapter because I don’t feel it is relevant to my own practices. Here I think I skimmed a few pages in Chapter 19 – Printing, but that is about it.

If you are a Silverlight developer, looking to move into that space or even have a casual interest in the technology, you will find Silverlight 4 in Action an indispensable guide.
