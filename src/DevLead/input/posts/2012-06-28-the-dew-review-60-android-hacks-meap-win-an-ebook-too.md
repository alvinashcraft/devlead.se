**EDIT: Congrats to eBook winners Terrance S. and Freek U! You will be receiving your eBooks soon.**

So, you just saw all of Google’s big announcements at their <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/" target="_blank">I/O conference</a> today and you want to build a cool new app for the new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb" target="_blank">Nexus 7 tablet</a>. If you have some experience developing on the platform but want to take your skills up a notch with some handy tips and tricks, you should check out a new title from Manning Publications.[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="sessa_cover150" src="/wp-content/uploads/sessa_cover150_thumb.jpg" alt="sessa_cover150" width="154" height="192" align="right" border="0" />][1]

<a href="http://manning.com/sessa/" target="_blank">60 Android Hacks</a> by Carlos Sessa is currently in <a href="http://manning.com/about/meap.html#meapfaq" target="_blank">MEAP</a> (Manning Early Access Program) with 23 of the 60 sections (hacks) currently available. I was given a chance to review the current version of the book over the last couple of weeks.

The Hacks are grouped into categories including Layout, Animation, Tools, and Patterns. Most of the hacks explain the purpose of the hack, provide some sample code and then walk through the code step by step. Any relevant links to Android SDK online documentation or other tools are provided at the end of each hack. The hacks are useful and easy to understand. It is evident that the author is an experienced Android developer. I have enjoyed what I have read so far and made use of several of the tips in a project of my own.

There are some hacks unavailable in the current MEAP that I am looking forward to reading. The Fragmentation section should prove to be very helpful with all the different version of Android out in the wild.

I encourage you to check it out for yourself. If you purchase a MEAP copy of the eBook, you will get regular updates and a copy of the final version of the eBook.

Manning has offered to give an eBook copy to two lucky readers. Just leave a comment below and let me know your favorite mobile platform (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.) I will choose two random commenters with valid email addresses.
