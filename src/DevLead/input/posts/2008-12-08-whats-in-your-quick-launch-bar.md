This post is in response to <a target="_blank" href="http://jeffblankenburg.com/2008/10/whats-in-your-quick-launch-bar.aspx">Jeff Blankenburg’s post</a> about the contents of his Quick Launch bar.

_Nothing._ Mine is turned off. Here’s what my start menu looks like though. I have turned off the display of my recently opened programs, and I dragged these shortcuts out there. _(This is my work notebook.)_

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="My Start Menu" border="0" alt="My Start Menu" src="/wp-content/uploads/image7.png" width="372" height="484" />

**Internet Explorer 8 –** I use it mainly to see what’s new in IE8 and when Firefox doesn’t render something correctly (hardly ever).

**Firefox 3 –** My primary web browser. The plug-in support is the difference-maker for me.

**Outlook 2007 –** Used for my work email. I also use the Outlook Connector to access one of my Hotmail accounts.

**Windows Live Mail –** I use this to access my other Hotmail account. I could put them both in Outlook, but I like to keep my hands in Live Mail too.

**visionapp Remote Desktop 2008 –** A fantastic remote desktop management tool with a very low price tag.

**Visual Studio 2005 –** Still some existing development work in VS2005.

**Visual Studio 2008 –** For all new development. Also, for playing around with new stuff out on CodePlex.

**SQL Server Management Studio &#8211;** ‘nuff said.

**Visual SourceSafe –** All of our old releases are still in VSS.&#160;&#160;&#160; _-cringe-_

**Command Prompt –** Launches as Administrator.

**FileZilla –** For all my FTP client needs, mostly for uploading files to my blog.

**Windows Live Writer Beta –** The best blogging client for Windows.

**Word 2007 –** Because it’s MS Word.

**Paint.NET –** My favorite image editing tool… and it’s free!

**Zune –** My current media player, but MediaMonkey is still the default on my home PC and my favorite.

**Services –** Because sometime you just have to stop some services.

**Event Viewer –** A developer’s friend.

**Programs and Features –** This is here because I’m always installing and uninstalling stuff from CodePlex and MS Downloads.

**Windows Update –** I want to be the first one to get my Windows Defender definition updates!

So, that’s my list. What’s in your Quick Launch bar and/or Start Menu and/or Launcher of choice?
