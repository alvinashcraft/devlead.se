Just a quick post about the upcoming, in-person, [TechBash 2021][1]. If you haven&#8217;t heard, the call for speakers is now open on Sessionize. Check it out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sessionize.com/techbash-2021/" target="_blank">here</a> and submit your sessions and workshops before June 4th.

We hope you&#8217;ll <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techbash.com/spread-the-word" target="_blank">tell your friends</a> and join us at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania" target="_blank">Kalahari Resort and Convention Center</a> in Pocono Manor, PA this October 19-22. We&#8217;ll have a day of full-day workshops on Oct 19th, followed by three days of sessions and networking with your peers. Read more about the CfP on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techbash.com/blog/2021/04/02/call-for-speakers-for-techbash-2021-now-open" target="_blank">TechBash blog</a> and follow <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techbash" target="_blank">TechBash on Twitter</a> for the latest news and updates.

If your company is interested in becoming a TechBash 2021 sponsor, our updated <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techbash.com/#Sponsors" target="_blank">sponsor prospectus</a> is now available too!

I hope to see some of you (at a safe distance) this fall in the Poconos!
