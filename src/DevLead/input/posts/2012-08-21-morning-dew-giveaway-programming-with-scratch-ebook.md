It’s giveaway time.

Manning has released a new book by Dr. Majed S. Marji titled <a href="http://www.manning.com/marji/" target="_blank">Programming with Scratch</a>. Scratch is a programming language developed at the MIT Media Lab. You can learn more about it at <http://scratch.mit.edu/>.

&nbsp;

Here’s a little more about Manning’s book on Scratch:

> Too often, the unfamiliar appearance and intimidating vocabulary of a standard programming language gets in the way of learning to think like a programmer. The Scratch programming language turns the tables, offering instead a colorful, comfortable programming environment designed especially for young coders. You build programs by snapping together graphical components, each of which corresponds to a standard programming concept. Scratch users get results immediately and are encouraged to keep exploring.

Morning Dew readers have a chance to win one of two eBook copies of Programming with Scratch. Just leave a comment below, any comment will do. You have until 11:59pm on Monday, August 27, 2012 to enter.

Just a reminder that multiple comments will not increase your chances of winning, and comments for unregistered users are moderated so your comment may not immediately appear.

Good luck!

Alvin
