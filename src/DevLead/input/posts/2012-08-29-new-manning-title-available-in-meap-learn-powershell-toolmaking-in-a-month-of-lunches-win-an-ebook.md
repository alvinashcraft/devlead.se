<a href="http://manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning Publications</a> has just released a new PowerShell book as a MEAP (<a href="http://manning.com/about/meap.html" target="_blank">Manning Early Access Preview</a>). This book, <a href="http://manning.com/jones4/" target="_blank">Learn PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches</a> by Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks, takes a hands-on approach to teaching readers to use PowerShell to build Windows admin tools. Every lesson is self-contained and can be followed over a one-hour lunch.

> Designed for IT professionals rather than developers, this book doesn&#8217;t require or assume any scripting or programming background or experience. Some experience using PowerShell as a command-line interface will prove helpful, and the authors&#8217; <a href="http://manning.com/jones3" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches</a>, Second Edition is an excellent way to get that background experience. Additional companion content is available for free from <a href="http://morelunches.com/" target="_blank">MoreLunches.com</a>.
