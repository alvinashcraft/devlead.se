<a href="https://kuai.fit/home/" target="_blank">KuaiFit</a> is a maker of personal trainer apps and sport headsets. A couple of weeks ago a representative from KuaiFit reached out to ask if I would be interested in a set of their new wireless earbuds in exchange for publishing my thoughts on the new product. Even though this is a &#8220;paid review&#8221; of sorts (just a free headset), you&#8217;ll get my honest impressions of the product.

The K Sport Headphones With In-Ear Personal Trainer just launched as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1384443073/k-sport-headphones-with-in-ear-personal-trainer?ref=9czlv5" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> this week. The super early bird is currently still available at approx. $20 U.S. Each set of these includes a free 3-month training plan on their mobile app. Being sweat and rain proof (IPX5), they ought to be perfect for working out.

I plan to use these headphones over the next several days for music, audiobooks and workouts, and will publish more detailed thoughts in a week or so. For now, I will provide my initial impressions after using them briefly last night. Let&#8217;s start with some unboxing pictures.

The contents of the box include:

  * Two wireless earbuds
  * A dual charging cable to charge both simultaneously from one USB port
  * Larger and smaller cushions to get a perfect fit
  * A sheet with some basic instructions and the training plan activation code

Setup and pair was simple and painless for me. After charging the set during dinner, I got them ready to go in about a minute. You press the &#8216;K&#8217; button on each earbud until the LED flashes red & blue to indicate it&#8217;s in pairing mode. Then open your phone&#8217;s Bluetooth settings and pair them like any other device. Whether one or both earbuds are on, they appear and act as a single device with your phone. (My phone is an Android &#8211; Moto Z2 Force.)

So far, I used the set with Audible and Spotify, listening to a few songs to check out the range. They sound crisp and clear with Hotel California, but could use a little more bass on Enter Sandman. At this size, weight and price point, I&#8217;m definitely willing to cut them a little slack on the lack of a more powerful, booming bass. The other thing I need to figure out is whether there is an option to configure the language on them. When pairing, the voice in the earphones sounds like some East Asian language. I&#8217;m no expert, and won&#8217;t assume which language I&#8217;m hearing. It may be that these early review units are not customized for the consumer&#8217;s country. I will clarify this before my full review is published.

I am sometimes a little hesitant to back a technology-based Kickstarter campaign, not knowing if the group can or will deliver on the product. I&#8217;ve been burned by a couple of smart watch campaigns in the past. However, I can assure that these earphones are not vapor. They&#8217;re already producing enough of them to sent out these early review units. At this price, they seem like a great option, but stay tuned for my full review in a couple of weeks. I&#8217;ll be sure to publish it well before the end of the campaign in 27 days.

Stay tuned!
