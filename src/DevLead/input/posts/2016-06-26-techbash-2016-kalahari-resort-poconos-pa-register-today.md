Here&#8217;s a great summary of TechBash written by one of our founders, <a href="http://twitter.com/schwammy" target="_blank">Andy Schwam</a>:

> Wondering why you should attend TechBash? There are lots of reasons. For starters, we&#8217;ve got great presentations for you by a variety of awesome speakers. Our venue, the Kalahari Resort is really cool. It is a brand new Resort, Conference Center, and 100,000 sq ft indoor water park! Location? TechBash is located in the Pocono Mountains in PA. That means it&#8217;s not only a beautiful setting but it&#8217;s close. If you are in the northeastern US and tired of flying cross country for tech conferences, TechBash is for you. We are less than a 2 hour drive from New Your City, Philadelphia, and northern NJ. And this location is still within reasonable driving distance of many other cities in the northeast!
> 
> We want to inspire our attendees to build great things. At TechBash, we are building an environment that is designed for attendees to get the most out of the event. In the many sessions at TechBash you will learn all sorts of new things. But we know that a lot of great things happen outside of the talks as well. That is why we will have a great attendee lounge that will have plenty of space for you to hang out and talk with old friends and new. It will provide a great place for speakers and attendees to have follow up talks after sessions. There will be snacks and coffee. And it will also include our Hack Lab and our vendors as well. The Hack Lab is a space for our attendees, speakers and sponsors to collaborate, brain storm, hack and even demo the results!
