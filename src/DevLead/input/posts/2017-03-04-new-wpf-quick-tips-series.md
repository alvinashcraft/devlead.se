_Hello Morning Dew readers._

I wanted to let my WPF loving readers know that I&#8217;ve started a new series of WPF quick tips. This will be a weekly (or more frequent) series of WPF tips based on my experiences developing WPF applications over the last 10 years or so. Most of the tips will be simple, quick hints. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll dive a little deeper into topics, as needed.

You can follow these tips over at <a href="http://www.wpf.tips/" target="_blank">WPF.tips</a> or just keep an eye on the **Xaml** section of the Dew Drop posts right here. I&#8217;ll be sure to link to each tip.

Thanks for following!

Alvin
