**EDIT: It looks like we got some bad intel about the Friday deal this week. Here is the correct info for today&#8217;s deal:**

> TODAY ONLY you can **SAVE 50% when you buy any two or more eBooks, pBooks, MEAPs, and liveVideo courses**! Just enter dotd122217lt in the Promotional Code box when you check out with two or more items in your cart. Expires at Midnight.

Another Friday deal from Manning leading into Christmas weekend…

Every day in December our partner Manning is offering a fantastic deal on their books and video courses as they countdown to 2018. They’ve given us another heads up that tomorrow they’re having a **50% off sale on all of their liveVideo titles for 24 hours**, and we thought you’d want to know!

All you have to do to get the offer is go to their Countdown to 2018 calendar and register your email address in the box at the top. After that, you’ll be sent the code at 12:00am EST directly to your email inbox. There’s a new deal every day, with each Friday holding the biggest deals of all.

They’re also offering a quiz on the calendar page for a chance to win a copy of every new book and video they release in 2018!
