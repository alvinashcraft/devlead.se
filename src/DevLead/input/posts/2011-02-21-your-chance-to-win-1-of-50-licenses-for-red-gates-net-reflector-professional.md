Most of my readers are probably aware of <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/announcement" target="_blank">Red Gate’s decision</a> to no longer offer a free edition of <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/" target="_blank">Reflector</a>, the .NET assembly decompiler and analyzer. <a href="http://devjourney.com/blog/red-gate-s-decision-to-commercialize-reflector/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DevJourney+%28Developer+Journey%29" target="_blank">Much</a> <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/rodpaddock/archive/2011/02/11/adiad.aspx" target="_blank">has already</a> <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2011/02/03/if-reflector-needed-money-so-badly-why-didnt-they-ask/" target="_blank">been said</a> about the decision, and I am not going to jump in to debate the politics/ethics of the decision at this time. The fact is, Reflector is a great utility for any .NET developer’s toolbox. I think that, in the end, this move is going to create some competition in the market and hopefully drive Reflector and its competitors to deliver better, more feature-rich tools. We have already seen a couple of free alternatives pop up (<a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2011/02/resharper-6-bundles-decompiler-free-standalone-tool-to-follow/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/danielgrunwald/archive/2011/02/04/ilspy-a-new-net-assembly-inspector.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>).

Red Gate has heard the concerns of the community and contacted me about running a promotion to help promote some goodwill. Over the next two weeks, you will have two chances to enter a contest sponsored by Red Gate. There will be 50 winners, each receiving a license for .NET Reflector Professional. There are two ways to enter:

  1. Leave a comment on this blog post. At the end of the contest I will choose, at random, 25 winners.
  2. <a href="http://twitter.com/alvinashcraft" target="_blank">Follow me</a> on Twitter and tweet this message. I will choose 25 random winners from the list of tweets.

> Hey @alvinashcraft. I want a copy of Reflector 7 from @redgate. #dewdrop

Here are a few rules/disclaimers/disclosures:

  * You can only win one license. If the same person is chosen in both the comments and tweets, another random name will be drawn.
  * The contest begins today, February 21, 2011 and ends on Friday, March 4, 2011.
  * Winners will be contacted no later than Tuesday, March 8, 2011.
  * As a Microsoft MVP and <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/community-relations/friends-of-rg" target="_blank">Friend of Red Gate</a>, I have free NFR licenses for Reflector and ANTS Profiler for personal use. I have not been compensated by Red Gate in any other way.
  * Gifts, bribes, complements, etc. will have NO influence on the outcome of this contest.

Good luck and thanks for reading The Dew!
