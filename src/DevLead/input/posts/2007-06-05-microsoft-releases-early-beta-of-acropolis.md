Microsoft has released CTP 1 of codename &#8216;Acropolis&#8217;. Acropolis helps developers build modular .NET applications. It&#8217;s primary focus appears to be WPF, but it supports WinForms UI components as well.

These tools and components will ship as an add-on to Visual Studio 2008, and Brad Abrams says they will become part of Visual Studio and the .NET Framework in a future release beyond that.

You can download the bits [here][1], and there are already several resources to help get you starting in building your own Acropolis-based UIs.

[Acropolis page on WindowsForms.net][2]

[Getting Started video][3]

[Help File on MS Downloads][4]

[Brad Abrams&#8217; blog has several good Acropolis links][5]

Go forth and build!
