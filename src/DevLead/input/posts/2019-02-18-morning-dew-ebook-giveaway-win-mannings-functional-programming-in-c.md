_EDIT: So, I got no tweets following the guidelines below, so I will be choosing three winners from the post comments here. Winners will be notified shortly! Thanks, all!_

Hey! It&#8217;s been a while since we did a giveaway here on the Dew. Let&#8217;s get one started today.

<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="functionalcsharp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/functionalcsharp.jpg" alt="functionalcsharp" width="218" height="218" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://www.manning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manning Books</a> has given me **three codes** for eBook copies of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Functional Programming in C#</a> written by <a href="https://twitter.com/la_yumba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enrico Buonanno</a>. Here&#8217;s the summary of the book from Manning&#8217;s site if you&#8217;re click-averse:

> Functional Programming in C# teaches you to apply functional thinking to real-world problems using the C# language. The book, with its many practical examples, is written for proficient C# programmers with no prior FP experience. It will give you an awesome new perspective.

Let&#8217;s keep the rules simple. You can enter in two different ways.

  1. Leave a comment on this post with the name of another .NET language book that you love. I&#8217;m always looking for recommendations.  <sub><img decoding="async" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></sub>
  2. Make sure you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/alvinashcraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">me on Twitter</a>, and tweet a message including the following five things:

  * @alvinashcraft
  * @manningbooks
  * @la_yumba
  * #MorningDewCsharp
  * Your favorite C# language feature in C# 7 or later

**I will select one winner from the eligible tweets and two winners from the blog comments.** Selections will be random, but you cannot win twice. I will select again if I pick the same person from both Twitter and blog comments. You must comment or tweet by 11:59pm GMT on Feb. 22nd, 2019. Winners will be notified by the end of the day on Feb. 25th, 2019. Tweet winner will be notified by Twitter DM. Blog comment winners will be notified by email.

_Good luck!_
