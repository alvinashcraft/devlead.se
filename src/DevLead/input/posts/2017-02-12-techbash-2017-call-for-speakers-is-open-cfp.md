  Hello!
</p>

If you’re a speaker and your calendar is open the week of Oct. 4-6, go check out <a href="http://www.techbash.com/" target="_blank">www.techbash.com</a> right now. The TechBash 2017 Call for Speakers is open through April 23rd. TechBash is looking for session submissions relevant to any Developer, Architect or IT Pro.

Want to see what sessions have been submitted so far? Check out the list at <a href="http://www.techbash.com/submissions" target="_blank">www.techbash.com/submissions</a>! In 2016, we had speakers come from all of the world to speak. So far in 2017, there have been submissions from speakers as far away as California. Maybe you can be the first international speaker to be considered for 2017.

The venue is amazing. The Kalahari Resort will soon be opening their <a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania/news-and-events/phase-ii/rides-attractions" target="_blank">major water park expansion</a>, making it the largest indoor water park in the United States. Everyone who books a room at the Kalahari gets free access to the water park on those days. Make sure you mention TechBash 2017 when you book your room because the room prices are incredible too (nightly rates starting at $139 Mon/Tue; $159 Wed/Thu; $169 Fri; $249 Sat).

If you’re not a speaker but are thinking about <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/techbash-2017-tickets-29484126817?aff=morningdew" target="_blank">attending TechBash 2017</a> this fall, the discounted ticket rate of $329 is available only through June. Last year, TechBash had great speakers, cool swag (a TechBash towel courtesy of Modis), really good food (breakfast & lunch daily plus a Welcome Reception on Day 1), and some free tours of the Kalahari facility. Go talk to your boss today and bring your co-workers! You don’t want to miss TechBash 2017.

Got a question? Send any speaker-specific questions to <a href="mailto:speaker@techbash.com" target="_blank">speaker@techbash.com</a> and general event questions to <a href="http://info@techbash.com/" target="_blank">info@techbash.com</a>.

Cheers!
