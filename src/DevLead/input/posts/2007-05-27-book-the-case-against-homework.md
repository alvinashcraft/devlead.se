[Cory Doctorow][1] at [Boing Boing][2] just [blogged][3] about a 2006 book &#8211; [The Case Against Homework][4]. It looks like a very interesting read. These types of books can sometimes be a bit one-sided, so it&#8217;s good to keep that in mind while reading them. Co-author Sara Bennett also has an anti-homework [website][5].

We are currently looking at a couple of pre-schools for our three-year-old daughter, so education issues are becoming more relevant to us. We live in a fairly good public school district, but are still considering other options such as homeschooling and/or private schools. Public schools seem to be more and more focused on standardized tests. It&#8217;s certainly clear that no matter what type of schooling your children get, it&#8217;s imperative that the parents are aware of how and what their children are being taught.
