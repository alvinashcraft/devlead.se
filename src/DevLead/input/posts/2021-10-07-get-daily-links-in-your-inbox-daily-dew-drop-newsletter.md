Some of you have been email subscribers to the Morning Dew in the past via <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedburner</a>. Now that Feedburner is in <a href="https://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/10483501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintenance mode</a> and no longer supports its newsletter feature, I have moved my email subscriptions to <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revue</a>.

Revue doesn&#8217;t offer the same direct RSS consumption to deliver each Dew Drop post as you would find it on here, so the format is slightly different. Each daily issue will contain links to the previous day&#8217;s Top Links and a link to the current Dew Drop post here.

If you would like to sign up, there is a signup widget on the sidebar of my blog, or you can subscribe on <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alvinashcraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Revue home page</a>. There is no cost to sign up and you can unsubscribe at any time with no future emails, ever. Everyone from my Feedburner email list was migrated to the Revue list. If you were part of that list, you can also unsubscribe at any time.

Give it a try and let me know what you think.

Cheers!

Alvin
