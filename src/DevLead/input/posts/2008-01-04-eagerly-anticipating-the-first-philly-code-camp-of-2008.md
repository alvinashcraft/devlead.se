<a href="http://www.phillydotnet.org/Meetings/MeetingEmails/2008/January122008/tabid/603/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Philly Code Camp 2008.1</a> will be held on Saturday, January 12th at <a href="http://www.devry.edu/locations/campuses/loc_ftwashingtoncampus.jsp" target="_blank">DeVry University in Fort Washington, PA</a>. There will be 8 tracks, 48 sessions and 400 seats.

This will be the first Philly Code Camp that I will be able to attend. My wife, Stelene, is a nurse and works every-other weekend. Every previous event has fallen on a weekend when she worked, and I was home with our two girls.

I am looking forward to participating in sessions with fantastic speakers like <a href="http://ruebush.com/" target="_blank">Mitch Ruebush</a> and <a href="http://samgentile.com/" target="_blank">Sam Gentile</a>, among many others. Sam is a huge part of the Philly developer community, I look forward to meeting him. I&#8217;ve seen Mitch speak on a couple of other occasions. First, back in March 2002, the company I worked for was getting us up to speed on .NET and C#, and Mitch was the trainer they brought in to lead a 5-day class. A year later I attended another Microsoft course, this time at <a href="http://onlc.com/" target="_blank">Online Consulting</a> in Center City Philly. I was working toward earning my MCT at the time, and had to take a course as part of the process. Mitch was the trainer, and offered several helpful tips during breaks and labs (got some good home theater tips too). He is a really sharp guy, and an engaging speaker.

Feel free to say hello if you see me there next week. I&#8217;ll be the geek wearing the black &#8216;<a href="http://www.zappa.com/zpz/index.html" target="_blank">Zappa Plays Zappa</a>&#8216; t-shirt. I will probably be spending most of my time in sessions within the Architecture track.
