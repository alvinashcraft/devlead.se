If you are a regular reader, you are probably familiar with <a href="https://www.techbash.com" target="_blank">TechBash</a>. It&#8217;s a 3-day conference for developers <a href="https://www.techbash.com/speakers" target="_blank">featuring top speakers</a> speaking about ASP.NET Core, DevOps, JavaScript, Mobile Development, Architecture and Design Patterns, Angular, Docker, C#, and much more!  
&nbsp;  
It all began with TechBash 2016 last September. TechBash is hosted annually at the <a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania" target="_blank">Kalahari Resort in Pocono Manor, PA</a>. The conference is only 90 minutes from NYC, Northern NJ, and Philadelphia. We bring in experts from around the country&nbsp; (and some from around the world) and fill an agenda with the content that modern developers need to know. This is our second year, happening October 4-6, and the event is shaping up to be even better.

At the time of this writing, we have announced <a href="https://www.techbash.com/sessions" target="_blank">32 speakers and 47 sessions</a>. Speakers are being contacted and confirmed daily, and we expect to have around 60 sessions at TechBash 2017.

Our discounted rate of $329 for this 3-day event ends soon! After July 21, tickets will increase to the full 2017 rate. Don&#8217;t forget to book your room at the Kalahari at our special low rate. After adding 3 hotel nights, you are still under $1,000 for an amazing conference at an awesome venue. Go talk to your boss and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/techbash-2017-tickets-29484126817" target="_blank">get your tickets ASAP</a>!

> TechBash is run by the <a href="http://techbashfoundation.org/" target="_blank">TechBash Foundation</a>, a 501(c)3 Not for Profit organization. It is entirely run by volunteers including myself. We make no money from this event.

Thanks for reading!
