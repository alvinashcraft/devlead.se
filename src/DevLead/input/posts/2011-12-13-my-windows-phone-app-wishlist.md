I love my Windows Phone, but the one thing that still needs improvement is the number of ‘big name’ apps available when compared to iOS and Android. This is a list of the ones that would make my day, in no particular order. I realize that there are apps for some of these, but I’m looking for official apps for the site/product.

  * Verizon FiOS DVR Manager
  * Verizon FiOS on Demand
  * Fidelity
  * US Airways
  * Amazon Cloud Drive
  * Amazon Cloud Player
  * Google+
  * Gmail
  * Google Reader
  * Angry Birds Seasons
  * Angry Birds Rio
  * NPR
  * Sportsline Fantasy Football
  * Sportsline Fantasy Baseball
  * Stack Overflow
  * WatchESPN
  * Audible _– I’m hearing March 2012 rumors on this one._
  * Dropbox
  * Box
  * Instapaper
  * Tumblr
  * Posterous
  * 7 Wonders (1, 2 & 3)
  * Worms
  * A good Bocce game

What do you think? Let’s see your lists.
