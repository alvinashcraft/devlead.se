The kids are back at school, the pro football season has started, and fall is arriving. That means time is running out to secure your tickets to TechBash and lock in our guaranteed low rates (_jump to the end for a 10% ticket discount_)!

### The TechBash room block ends on October 13th!

The Kalahari Resort just extended the TechBash room block by one week. Book your room by Friday the 13th! Right now, room rates are just $179 per night for a standard Desert room on Monday through Friday nights during TechBash. You can reserve your room through the Kalahari [booking site][2] or by phone at 1-877-525-2427 (mention TechBash). After October 13th, rates and availability are no longer guaranteed!

Remember that your Kalahari Room includes full waterpark access for up to four people (including yourself). All-day waterpark admission normally costs $69.99 per person (or $45 for an evening). Bring your family, and the room more than pays for itself!

### Standard tickets were extended too!

Not only that, but our Standard 3-day and 4-day event pricing was also extended until October 13th. For the final 23 days before TechBash, Late Bird pricing will be in effect. So, don&#8217;t wait&#8230; [Register today][3]!
