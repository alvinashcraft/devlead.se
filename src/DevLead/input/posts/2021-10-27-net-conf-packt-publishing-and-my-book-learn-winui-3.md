.NET Conf 2021 is coming up on <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 9-11</a>. It&#8217;s going to be an exciting week with both Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6 being released. There has been no date announced yet for the Windows App SDK 1.0 and WinUI 3 release, but I expect them to launch very soon as well. We do know that the third release candidate for Windows App SDK 1.0 will be coming this week!

<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packt Publishing</a> is one of the <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/#sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsors</a> of .NET Conf this year. They will also be taking part in the secret decoder challenge for conference attendees. The contest will give the audience the chance to win a $500 prize from Packt. Make sure you watch .NET Conf to find out how you can participate and win great prizes from many of the sponsors, including Packt.
