_Posting the video from Viddler for those who did not get to attend this live webcast._

From the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet/browse_thread/thread/7f514c1ac1e2d4cd#" target="_blank">Virtual ALT.NET Google Group</a>:

> Who is and what makes this Billy McCafferty guy tick? Well he is a long time developer and a hopeless romantic when it comes to writing beautiful software. Billy currently leads a double life between helping to run a small training and consulting company known as Codai (which will be getting a new website very very soon) and filling the role of lead developer and architect with Parsons Brinckerhoff. After Billy gets his life back – which should be after the release of S#arp Architecture 1.0 – expect to see him soon at ALT.NET and other development conferences.

In this video from the April 22nd <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet" target="_blank">Virtual ALT.NET (VAN)</a> meeting, Billy demonstrates the latest cut of S#harp Architecture 1.0 with a 45-50 minute non-PPT presentation.
