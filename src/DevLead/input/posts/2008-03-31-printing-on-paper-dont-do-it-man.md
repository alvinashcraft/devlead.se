Over the weekend, my friend and former co-worker, [Matt Walker][1], blogged about [the &#8216;need&#8217; to print documents on paper][2]. I couldn&#8217;t agree more, and wanted to add a couple of points to the discussion.

For anyone who has issues reading from an LCD or CRT for long periods of time, you can pick up a [Sony Reader][3] or [Amazon Kindle][4]. Sony&#8217;s device will display .doc, .rtf, .pdf, and .txt files out of the box. PDFs can be a little hard to read on the device because of how they are scaled, but there are 3rd party tools out there to convert PDF to RTF.

Matt talks about [a free tool to print to PDF files][5]. Another e-printing option built into Windows Vista is the [&#8220;Microsoft XPS Document Writer&#8221; printer][6]. You can create a portable document without installing any 3rd party tools. This option is for anyone who exclusively uses systems that can read the .xps format.

Peace out!
