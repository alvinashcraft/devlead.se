We all knew this day would come. The Opie and Anthony Show is threatened by people who want to control what should be heard on the radio. Don Imus was fired for making a bad joke about a woman&#8217;s basketball team, JV & Elvis were suspended indefinitely from FreeFM for satire on Asian accents, and now some special interest groups will say they are offended (in order to gain publicity for their cause) because a homeless person commented on what he would like to do to Condoleezza Rice on The Opie & Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.

Preemptively, we should contact Opie and Anthonyâ€™s bosses and explain why they should stand with them. People usually only write letters when they are told things are offensive. The silent majority loses when they remain silent. These special interest groups who claim to know what should be heard/seen think everything should be nice and not be made fun of. But offensive humor can be refreshing and is protected by the 1st Amendment.

So to prevent the minority from ruling the majority please write, email and call these people. Remind them it is important that a corporation stands up for the users of their product and not succumb to the demands of people who do not. We have enjoyed The Opie and Anthony show for years, and now they need our help.

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is \___\___\___\_____\_\\_\_, I am an XM Subscriber and currently have \_\__ subscriptions under my account. My account number is \___\___\___\___ .

I am a fan of XM general, Opie and Anthony in specific and more importantly, I am a strong supporter of Freedom of Speech.  
I realize you will get grief from protesters and those that want Opie and Anthony removed for your airwaves. Please stay strong and do not give in to these special interest groups.

Remember, most of them are not subscribers, I however am. I pay for your service and support your sponsors. Buy caving in to the demands of the few, you lose the support of those of us who are actually using your service.

While you MAY lose a few sponsors, by bowing down to the demands of these groups, you WILL lose customers.  
Sponsors will come back, dissatisfied customers will not.

Thank you for your time.
