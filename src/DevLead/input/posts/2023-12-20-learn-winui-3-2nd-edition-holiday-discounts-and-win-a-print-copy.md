_Happy holidays!_ This is just a quick heads-up to let you know that I&#8217;m giving away a print copy of my latest book, [Learn WinUI 3, 2nd Edition][1], over on LinkedIn. If you have a U.S. shipping address, all you need to do to enter is leave a comment on the [LinkedIn post from yesterday][2].

There are also a couple of ways you can save when buying a copy of the book. If you prefer eBooks, Packt&#8217;s winter sale is going on now. You can get [Learn WinUI 3][3], any of my other books, or any Packt video or eBook for only **$10**.

If you&#8217;re a fan of print books, you can get a physical copy of [Learn WinUI 3][1] for 20% off on Amazon through December 31st. Just enter promo code 20LWUI during checkout. This discount is currently only available on the U.S. Amazon site. I&#8217;m looking into whether we can make it available to other regions. However, they tell me that the book is currently 10% off in other regions.
