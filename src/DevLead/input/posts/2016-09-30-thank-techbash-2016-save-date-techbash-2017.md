This is just a quick note to say thank you to all of the [TechBash][1] attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, as well as the [Kalahari][2] staff and my fellow [organizers][3]. From all of the feedback we have received so far this week, it feels like TechBash 2016 was a success.

This morning before [Glenn Block&#8217;s][5] &#8220;How OSS Is Changing the World&#8221; keynote session we announced that we will return to the Kalahari Resort & Waterpark October 4-6, 2017. Please save the date. In the coming weeks we will have announcements about early bird pricing and availability. We hope to see you at TechBash 2017!

Stay tuned for a more complete wrap-up post next week.
