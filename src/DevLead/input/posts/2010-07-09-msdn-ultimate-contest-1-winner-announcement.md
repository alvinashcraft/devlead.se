I received a lot of great entries for the first [MSDN giveaway][1] this week, which made it very difficult to choose a winner. In the end I selected [Marc Scheuner][2] because I felt he most closely fits the ‘community influencer’ mold. He [has been an MVP][3] in previous years and has answered thousands of questions on [Stack Overflow][4]. I giving him the subscription will have the greatest impact on the community. I will be contacting Marc shortly to work out the details.

Remember there is still a [second contest][1] that does not end until next Friday. Check out the [original post][1] for all the information. The competition is still wide open!

_Best of luck and congratulations to Marc!!!_
