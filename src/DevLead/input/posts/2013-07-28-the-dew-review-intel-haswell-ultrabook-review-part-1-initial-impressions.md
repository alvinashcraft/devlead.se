On Tuesday, I received a package I have been anticipating for several weeks. I had been asked to use and review a new generation of Ultrabook from Intel with a shiny new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)" target="_blank">Haswell</a> processor inside. This is the first of three articles about the unit. I have had a few days to unbox and take it for a spin.

The unboxing process is always a great time. Here are a few shots of the Ultrabook being removed of it’s musical box. Yes, like a Hallmark card, the box plays a little jingle when you open it. In this case, the Intel jingle of course.

[<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="The Box" alt="The Box" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_001_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][1][<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Front of the Box" alt="Front of the Box" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_002_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][2][<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Opening the Lid" alt="Opening the Lid" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_003_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][3][<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="What Lies Beneath" alt="What Lies Beneath" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_004_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][4][<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Accessories" alt="Accessories" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_005_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][5][<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Keyboard and Touchpad" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad" src="/wp-content/uploads/WP_20130723_006_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][6]

Inside the box, I found:

  * The Ultrabook
  * The power cord, with a pleasingly small brick
  * A 16gb thumb drive containing drivers and software
  * A quick start guide
  * A spec sheet
  * A USB to Ethernet adapter
  * A micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter
  * A micro-HDMI to VGA adapter

The specs on the machine are pretty impressive. I may have added more RAM if I were building it myself, but beggars can’t be choosers. <img decoding="async" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/wlEmoticon-smile6.png" /> 

  * CPU: Intel Haswell i5
  * 180GB SSD Hard Drive
  * 4GB RAM
  * Accelerometer/Magnetometer/Gyro meter/Ambient Light Sensor
  * GPS Sensor
  * NFC
  * 1.3MP WebCam
  * MultiTouch Pad
  * (2) USB 3.0 Ports
  * Micro HDMI
  * SIM and SD Card Readers
  * MultiTouch Screen (1920&#215;1080 resolution)

I quickly got Visual Studio 2012, Xamarin Studio, and a host of other development software installed. Visual Studio runs great. In fact, I presented at the <a href="http://firststatedot.net/" target="_blank">First State .NET user group</a> meeting on Thursday night and decided to use the Ultrabook to do the presentation. It worked great and became a part of the Q&A at the end of the session. Everyone there noticed it and wanted to know all about it.

The only thing I am still adjusting to is the clickable multitouch pad. I have gotten into the bad habit of resting my left index finger on the left button when using touchpads on my other laptops. When I do that with this Ultrabook, my finger is resting on the corner of the touchpad. I ended up doing a bit more pinching and zooming than I intended over the last few day. I think I will be able to break that habit pretty quickly.

All in all, I am loving this machine so far and plan to use it as my primary machine outside of work. Stay tuned for review part two in a few weeks. I will have a little more time with the Haswell unit at that time and will spend more time talking about the development experience on the machine.
