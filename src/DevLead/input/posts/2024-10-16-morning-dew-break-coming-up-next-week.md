The daily **Dew Drop** posts will be taking a break for about a week and a half. I&#8217;m taking some personal time off and unplugging after Friday. So, there will be no daily links from Monday, October 21st through Wednesday, October 30th.

I should be back on the 31st, but I won&#8217;t be including most of the blog posts that folks share in that time in-between. If there are any major announcements from Microsoft and other &#8220;companies of interest&#8221;, I&#8217;ll flag those to be included upon my return.

I&#8217;m also experimenting with migrating from WordPress to a static site, and I&#8217;d like to bring my 4800+ blog posts along with me. If you have any recommendations for static site generators that can build sites of that size without memory heap issues in JavaScript, give me a heads-up. My brief experimentation with Astro didn&#8217;t go well. See this <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/1711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub issue</a> for others running into a similar problem. I ran into the issue on Netlify, GitHub Actions, and when building the prod site locally (even with <font face="Consolas">NODE_OPTIONS=&#8211;max_old_space_size=8192</font> set).

Thanks for continuing to follow the daily links on the Morning Dew. We&#8217;re coming up to 17 years of sharing links in early November. Cheers!
