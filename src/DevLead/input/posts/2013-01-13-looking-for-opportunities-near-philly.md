[EDIT: 29-Jan-2013]: I have accepted a new position with Corporation Service Company (CSC) in Wilmington, DE and will be starting there on Feb. 4th. I am looking forward to the new challenges that lay ahead. Thanks to all of you who reached out over the last several weeks!

&nbsp;

I recently (Nov. 2012) rejoined Allscripts in Malvern, PA as an Expert Software Engineer. I have enjoyed my time back at the company, getting to dive back into some WPF/MVVM work. I returned to work with a group of people that I like and respect. Unfortunately, I have good reason to believe that Allscripts has decided to close some offices this week, including the one in Malvern.

If any of my Philadelphia-area peeps knows of any great opportunities in the area, please reach out. Here’s a summary of my skills and professional interests.

#### Skilled with Work Experience

  * C#
  * VB.NET
  * WPF
  * MVVM
  * WinForms (with WPF interop)
  * ASP.NET
  * JavaScript
  * SQL Server
  * Unit Testing
  * Agile Development (SCRUM, task boards, 2-3 week sprints, daily stand-ups, planning)
  * SSRS

#### Skilled, Strong Interest, but Only Experience is Personal or Used in Demos/Presentations

  * Windows Phone 7/8
  * WinRT XAML/C#
  * Cross-Platform Apps with both Telerik Icenium and DevExpress DXTREME
  * Cordova (PhoneGap)
  * jQuery/Knockout.js
  * Single-Page Applications
  * ASP.NET MVC
  * ASP.NET MVC WebAPI
  * TDD
  * Pair Programming

#### Strong Interest, Some Knowledge, but Limited Exposure

  * Android Development
  * MonoDroid
  * MonoTouch
  * iOS Development
  * node.js
  * Windows Azure
  * KendoUI

I have nearly 18 years of development experience on the Microsoft stack now. I have a passion for what I do, which is evidenced by the fact that I have been awarded as a Microsoft MVP four times. I would like to find a company that shares my passion for Microsoft dev technologies. I am hoping to find an opportunity where I will be surrounded by other smart, passionate developers… someplace where I can continue to advance and grow my skills over a long period of time.

Here is a <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=E90F5102D7DC3136!9436&authkey=!ANlD1xQ5oLlG70s" target="_blank">current copy of my resume</a>. If you know anyone who is interested in hiring an experienced .NET developer, please send them my way. If you have multiple openings, I know of other great developers, testers and business analysts who will also be looking for work soon.

_Thanks!_
