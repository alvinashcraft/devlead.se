I recently received a review copy of <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/customizing-asp-net-core-6-0-second-edition/9781803233604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customizing ASP.NET Core 6.0</a> in eBook format. This <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packt Publishing</a> title was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/sharpcms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jürgen Gutsch</a> and will be available in early 2022 (you can pre-order <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Customizing-ASP-NET-Core-6-0-applications/dp/1803233605/?tag=amavin-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">print</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Customizing-ASP-NET-Core-6-0-applications-ebook/dp/B09K4329QC/?tag=amavin-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kindle</a> versions now).

This is not your run-of-the-mill &#8220;getting started with ASP.NET Core&#8221; book. There are plenty of books and other online resources to get started building web applications with .NET. This book assumes you are familiar with the basics of ASP.NET Core development and dives right into the intermediate and advanced concepts (the good stuff). These are the things developers need to understand to build really robust, scalable, performant web applications.

I won&#8217;t re-hash the entire table of contents for you, but some of the most important (in my opinion) topics covered are:

  * Writing a BackgroundService
  * Writing Custom Middleware
  * Working with ASP.NET Core Identity and Customizing Identity Management
  * Custom ModelBinders and ActionFilters
  * Caching concepts

The sample code for each chapter is concise, self-contained, and can be applied to real-world applications. All of this sample code is freely available to readers on <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Customizing-ASP.NET-Core-6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. I love that Packt using GitHub for their books&#8217; sample code. It&#8217;s a great way for readers to work with the code and interact with the author and other community members. Readers have provided some great feedback to me through GitHub issues on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/learn-winui-3-0/9781800208667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my WinUI book</a>&#8216;s repository.

The author does a great job covering the topics that are important to enterprise web application developers using the latest recommended techniques in ASP.NET Core 6. I would recommend this book to ASP.NET Core developers or other experienced .NET developers looking to get started building web apps.

Happy reading!
