Many Opie and Anthony listeners (including myself) are boycotting XM partners and sponsors until O&A return to the air uncensored. You can find a comprehensive list of sponsors [here][1]. Their partners include MLB, NASCAR, NHL and General Motors. Be sure you copy eric.logan@xmradio.com on all of your boycott emails to these companies.
